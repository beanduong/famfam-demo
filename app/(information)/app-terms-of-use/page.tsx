          10.1 The User Contract is concluded for an indefinite period. You and
          FAMFAM may terminate the User Contract at any time with a notice
          period of two (2) weeks to the end of each calendar month. After

        </p>
        <p>

          Account if FAMFAM does not register any activity on the User Account
          for a period of two (2) years. In this case, FAMFAM reserves the right
          to delete the data in the User Account and to inform You of the
          deletion in a suitable form in advance.

        <p>
          10.4 Each party has the right to terminate the User Contract for good
          cause without observing a notice period. An important reason for
          FAMFAM is in particular:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A breach of the provisions of these Terms by the User which is not
            remedied even after a deadline has been set;
          </li>
          <li>
            a criminal act by the User or the attempt to commit such an act,
            e.g., fraud, or
          </li>
          <li>
            default on a payment obligation in accordance with the agreed
            payment to be made by the User.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          10.5 The statutory right of withdrawal under applicable consumer
          protection laws to which the User might be entitled remains
          unaffected.

        <h2>12. Amendment of these Terms</h2>
        <p>
          FAMFAM reserves the right to amend these Terms, e.g., in the event of
          changes of legal obligations or market conditions, to the extent such
          amendment is reasonable for the User, taking into account the
          interests of the User. FAMFAM will inform the User at least six weeks
          before the amendment comes into effect. If the User does not object to
          the amended Terms coming into force within four weeks after such
          information about the amendment, the amended Terms shall be deemed
          agreed. FAMFAM will specifically inform the User at the beginning of
          the aforementioned period of the effect of the Users behavior.
        </p>

          of Goods. If the User is a consumer and has his / her habitual
          residence in another country at the time of the conclusion of the User
          Contract or another contract with FAMFAM, the application of mandatory
          legal provisions of this country shall remain unaffected by the choice
          of law made in the foregoing sentence.
        </p>
        <p>
          13.2 Should individual provisions of these Terms prove to be legally
          invalid, the remaining parts of Terms shall remain binding. In this
          case, the parties shall mutually agree on an effective provision that
          corresponds as closely as possible to the original intention of the
          parties.
